twitter feed will have options to dump tweets related to a single keyword
this data stream has multiple traits that can be analyzed to judge sentiment
    - liveliness, tweets per minute
    - time between tweets
    - swear word density
    - follower count average of tweeter i.e how much "high profile" visibility is this getting

machine learning
    - input tweets would be tagged as either good or bad sentiment, training data manually classified
    - test data could see if neural net classifies properly, could be expanded to any keyword??

android bug tracking - track list of keywords related to android
scan tweets for security-specific words, keep count of these
when there are more than X in Y time, alert somehow and extract the topics
this means there has been an uptick in interest over a specific android topic that we want to know about
